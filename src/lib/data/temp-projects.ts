    approach: [
      "The concept uses the front gate, fountain, foyer, and great room as a deliberate sequence of increasing scale, giving the estate a strong narrative from first approach through primary gathering space.",
      "The material palette stays classic, but the composition is edited so the home feels intentional rather than overloaded.",
    ],
    build: [
      "Interior rooms are large and formal, but the planning still preserves clarity, with each public space having a legible purpose and a relationship to the outdoor entertaining program.",
      "The backyard strategy treats pool, terrace, and landscape as one luxury system that supports both quiet use and larger social events.",
    ],
    result: [
      "The concept rounds out the five-project temporary set with the most formal estate expression of the group and gives the portfolio review a distinct Bel Air presence.",
      "It also creates a strong approval-page anchor because the architecture reads immediately, even before a viewer gets into details.",
    ],
    takeaways: [
      "Formal luxury still needs a clear sequence or it can feel theatrical rather than expensive.",
      "Bel Air projects benefit from strong privacy cues at the entry, not just at the backyard.",
      "Large-scale entertaining works best when the outdoor program is structured, not simply expansive.",
