    challenge: [
      "The clients had been searching the West San Fernando Valley for over a year and could not find an existing home in Calabasas that met their standards for craftsmanship, layout, and indoor-outdoor flow. They came to econstruct ready to build from the ground up but needed a partner who could manage architecture, permitting, and construction under one roof.",
      "The brief was demanding: a 6,500 sq ft California Mediterranean estate with authentic architectural character, a true indoor-outdoor great room, a primary suite retreat, a chef's kitchen with full appliance package, and a resort-style backyard — all delivered within an aggressive 17-month timeline that left no room for change orders or trade coordination missteps.",
    ],
    approach: [
      "econstruct managed the project end to end as the general contractor — from coordinating the architectural and engineering team through final landscaping. The clients had a single point of contact and a single accountable party for every milestone.",
      "Our preconstruction strategy partner ran the permit and plan-check process in parallel with foundation prep, compressing what would normally be a 9-12 month design-permit cycle into roughly 7 months. This is the same model we use on every Calabasas, Hidden Hills, and Pacific Palisades custom build.",
      "Material selections were made early and locked in: hand-troweled stucco, authentic clay tile roof, walnut hardwood flooring, marble and quartzite stone packages, Wolf and Sub-Zero kitchen appliances, and a Crestron home automation system. Locking the spec early eliminated change orders mid-build.",
    ],
    build: [
      "Foundation and framing were completed in 4 months, including site prep, slab work, and rough utilities. Disciplined sequencing kept the schedule moving even through California's winter weather windows.",
      "Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing rough-ins were sequenced to allow the framing inspection and drywall to start while the smart home wiring (Crestron, Lutron, Sonos, security) was pulled. This kind of trade coordination is where most luxury custom home projects lose months — disciplined sequencing kept us on track.",
      "Finish work — flooring, cabinetry, stonework, tile, plaster, and millwork — was executed by our long-standing subcontractor network. Every Calabasas estate we deliver runs through the same vetted trades, which is why the finish quality stays consistent project after project.",
      "Landscape, pool, hardscape, and outdoor kitchen construction ran in parallel with interior finishes during the final 3 months. The clients moved into a fully finished home with both indoor and outdoor living spaces ready on day one.",
    ],
    result: [
      "A 6,500 sq ft California Mediterranean custom home delivered in 17 months — on schedule, on budget, and ready for the family to move in.",
      "The completed estate has become a flagship project on the econstruct Calabasas portfolio. The combination of authentic Mediterranean architecture, modern open-plan interiors, and a true indoor-outdoor great room is exactly what high-end Calabasas buyers and builders look for.",
      "The clients now have a forever home that reflects their lifestyle, holds long-term value in one of the most desirable Calabasas neighborhoods, and was built with the kind of craftsmanship that does not require corrective work years down the line.",
    ],
    takeaways: [
      "Calabasas custom home builds reward early decision-making — locking the architectural style, material spec, and smart-home plan before breaking ground prevents the change orders that blow up most luxury projects.",
      "Calabasas, Hidden Hills, and West San Fernando Valley permitting can add months to a typical timeline. Working with a contractor who runs preconstruction strategy in parallel with the permit process is the difference between a 17-month build and a 24-month build.",
      "Indoor-outdoor flow is the single most-requested feature on Calabasas new construction. Designing for it from day one — disappearing glass walls, covered patio, outdoor kitchen, pool sightlines from the great room — is what separates a custom home from a tract build.",
      "If you're considering a ground-up custom home build in Calabasas, Hidden Hills, Westlake Village, or anywhere in the West San Fernando Valley, econstruct can run the full process from preconstruction strategy through final landscaping. Schedule a consultation to walk through your lot, your design ideas, and your timeline.",

    challenge: [
      "The condo had a segmented, outdated layout that disconnected the kitchen from the living areas and failed to take advantage of its proximity to the beach.",

    approach: [
      "econstruct restructured the floor plan first — removing walls, enlarging doorways, and creating a new kitchen-to-dining connection with pocket doors that open the space fully.",
